BUGS:

- deleting an author then clicking their name in the author list before it reloads lets you load that author in the edit form
  (race condition)

  maybe dispatch an action like 'AUTHOR_DELETED' from the 'DELETE_AUTHOR' mutation and then the form can use that to update the list


FEATURES:

- action creator functions (started)
- courseActions.test.js implementation
- form validation
- author delete validations

- code-splitting    http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Async-Components
- vue-focus     https://github.com/simplesmiler/vue-focus
