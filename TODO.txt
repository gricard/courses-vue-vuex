BUGS:

- deleting an author then clicking their name in the author list before it reloads lets you load that author in the edit form
  (race condition)

  maybe dispatch an action like 'AUTHOR_DELETED' from the 'DELETE_AUTHOR' mutation and then the form can use that to update the list


FEATURES:

- form validation
- author delete validations
- ajax call error pass back error
- action creator functions

- code-splitting    http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Async-Components
- vue-focus     https://github.com/simplesmiler/vue-focus
