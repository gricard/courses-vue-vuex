BUGS:

- deleting an author then clicking their name in the author list before it reloads lets you load that author in the edit form
  (race condition)

  maybe dispatch an action like 'AUTHOR_DELETED' from the 'DELETE_AUTHOR' mutation and then the form can use that to update the list

- saving/deleting a course and then being redirected back to the course list results in a slow load of course list to update it
  need to make this seamless


FEATURES:

- action creator functions (started)
- courseActions.test.js implementation

- code-splitting    http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Async-Components
- vue-focus     https://github.com/simplesmiler/vue-focus
