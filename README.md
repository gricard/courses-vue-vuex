> A VueJS 2 / vuex / vue-router project

This is an implementation of [a react/redux application I made](https://github.com/sumorai/courses-react-redux) while participating in [Corey House](https://github.com/coryhouse)'s excellent [React/Redux course on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6). 
After I finished the react/redux course, VueJS caught my interest and I decided to implement the same application in VueJS instead.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install 

     OR 

yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

Note: This is not a real, full application. It was just an educational exercise. I'm making it public only because it could be helpful to others.

I have no offiliation with Pluralsight.
